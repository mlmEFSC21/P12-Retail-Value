# P12-Retail-Value
Module 8 Project 2 (Week's Retail Value)

Requirements
A mail-order house sells five different products whose retail prices are as follows:

product 1, $2.98;
product 2, $4.50;
product 3, $9.98;
product 4, $4.49; and
product 5, $6.87.
Write a script that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:

Product number
Quantity sold for one day
Your program should use a switch statement to determine each productâ€™s retail price and should calculate and output HTML5 that displays the total retail value of all the products sold. Use a prompt dialog to obtain the product number and quantity from the user. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.
